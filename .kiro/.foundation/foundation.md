# **📜 YieldQuest — Project Foundation Document**

## **1\. Project Overview**

**Project Name:** YieldQuest  
**Category:** GameFi × Social × DeFi  
**Target Network:** Mantle Network (EVM-compatible L2)

### **One-liner**

**YieldQuest transforms real DeFi yield on Mantle into a social, competitive game experience where users earn progress, reputation, and on-chain achievements.**

---

## **2\. Problem Statement**

### **Current Issues**

* DeFi yield products are:

  * Passive

  * Hard to understand

  * Non-social

* GameFi projects often:

  * Use fake yield

  * Rely on inflationary rewards

  * Collapse when incentives stop

### **Opportunity**

There is **no consumer-facing product** that:

* Uses **real yield**

* Is **fun & competitive**

* Encourages **long-term engagement**

* Is built natively on Mantle

---

## **3\. Solution: YieldQuest**

YieldQuest introduces a **Quest-based Yield Game**, where:

* Users **deposit into real yield vaults**

* Yield is converted into:

  * XP

  * Levels

  * Badges

  * Social reputation

* Players compete individually or in guilds

* Progress is transparent and verifiable on-chain

---

## **4\. Core Product Pillars**

### **4.1 Real Yield First**

* All rewards are backed by **actual yield**
